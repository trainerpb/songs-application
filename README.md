I want to see these fesatures

1. Show all the singers on  a web page 

2. The singers should appear hyperlinked.
   If you click on a hyperlink for singer let us say, 'Rafi' , we should see all the songs we have in the table sung by the artiste 

3. You have already understood the pain of 
  writing HTML+CSS in a servlet===> JSP



JSP (in brief) = HTML + Scriptlets that translates to a Servlet that YOU DID NOT WRITE! (That's enough to know- details- Ref. to Slides I will provide you with)


Node ==>   EJS templating 


Python  ==> Jinja2
